## ðŸ§  Architecture

PodcastChallenge uses the **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** pattern:

- **Model** - State data (via `StateFlow`, Room entities, Repository)
- **View** - Jetpack Compose UI that reacts to state
- **Intent** - Events triggered by user actions and dispatched to ViewModel

This results in a **unidirectional data flow**, making the app easier to debug, maintain, and test.
